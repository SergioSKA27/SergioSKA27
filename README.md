Pleased to meet you! I'm a passionate student of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, currently pursuing my bachelor's degree at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, FES Acatl√°n. My academic journey revolves around gaining solid theoretical knowledge and technical programming skills.

Beyond the classroom, I thrive on applying my skills to tackle complex challenges and contribute to innovative projects, with a particular focus on data analysis and software development. I aim not only to solve problems but also to generate impactful solutions.

In addition to my academic commitment, I've led projects such as developing an educational website for a university club, where I merged web programming skills with a passion for improving educational accessibility.

Outside academia, I've shared my enthusiasm for mathematics as a seminar presenter and university workshop facilitator. My ability to communicate complex concepts in an accessible way reflects my dedication to knowledge-sharing and collective learning.

I'm excited about the opportunities within the realms of applied mathematics and computer science and eager to continue exploring and growing in these fields. Connect with me on LinkedIn or check out my projects on GitHub to learn more about my journey and contributions!
